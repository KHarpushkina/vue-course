            "name": "10 Things Most People Learn Too Late In Life",
            "content": "Life is a journey of twists and turns, peaks and valleys, mountains to climb and oceans to explore. Good times and bad times. Happy times and sad times. But always, life is a movement forward. No matter where you are on the journey, in some way, you are continuing on — and that’s what makes it so magnificent. One day, you’re questioning what on earth will ever make you feel happy and fulfilled. And the next, you’re perfectly in flow, writing the most important book of your entire career. What nobody ever tells you, though, when you are a wide-eyed child, are all the little things that come along with “growing up.” 1. Most people are scared of using their imagination. They’ve disconnected with their inner child. They don’t feel they are “creative.” They like things “just the way they are.” 2. Your dream doesn’t really matter to anyone else. Some people might take interest. Some may support you in your quest. But at the end of the day, nobody cares, or will ever care about your dream as much as you. 3. Friends are relative to where you are in your life. Most friends only stay for a period of time — usually in reference to your current interest. But when you move on, or your priorities change, so too do the majority of your friends. 4. Your potential increases with age. As people get older, they tend to think that they can do less and less — when in reality, they should be able to do more and more, because they have had time to soak up more knowledge. Being great at something is a daily habit. You aren’t just “born” that way. 5. Spontaneity is the sister of creativity. If all you do is follow the exact same routine every day, you will never leave yourself open to moments of sudden discovery. Do you remember how spontaneous you were as a child? Anything could happen, at any moment! 6. You forget the value of “touch” later on. When was the last time you played in the rain? When was the last time you sat on a sidewalk and looked closely at the cracks, the rocks, the dirt, the one weed growing between the concrete and the grass nearby. Do that again. You will feel so connected to the playfulness of life. 7. Most people don’t do what they love. It’s true. The “masses” are not the ones who live the lives they dreamed of living. And the reason is because they didn’t fight hard enough. They didn’t make it happen for themselves. And the older you get, and the more you look around, the easier it becomes to believe that you’ll end up the same. Don’t fall for the trap. 8. Many stop reading after college. Ask anyone you know the last good book they read, and I’ll bet most of them respond with, “Wow, I haven’t read a book in a long time.” 9. People talk more than they listen. There is nothing more ridiculous to me than hearing two people talk “at” each other, neither one listening, but waiting for the other person to stop talking so they can start up again. 10. Creativity takes practice. It’s funny how much we as a society praise and value creativity, and yet seem to do as much as we can to prohibit and control creative expression unless it is in some way profitable. If you want to keep your creative muscle pumped and active, you have to practice it on your own."

            "name": "The Spanish sweet you gamble to eat",
            "content": "For more than 130 years, Spanish street food hawkers have peddled artisanal sweets that people can only eat after spinning a roulette wheel. Now, this tradition may soon vanish. I flung the roulette wheel anticlockwise, sending the golden ticker spinning over dozens of white and yellow numbers from zero to 10. To the hypnotic sound of a heartbeat-fast tick, tick, tick, I watched with bated breath as the marker deliberated over my fate. An inch to the right and I’d be rewarded with a 10, the highest and most sought-after number on the wheel; an inch to the left, and I’d leave with nothing. It was a hot August afternoon on northern Spain’s Salinas beach, and bikini-wearing crowds had gathered behind me while I gambled for Guillermo Pelayo’s famous barquillos, wafer-thin, vanilla-scented biscuits oozing with warm honey. Traditionally, customers pay a set fee to spin the barquillero’s roulette wheel. Whatever number the marker lands on is the number of wafer biscuits you win for your set fee. If the marker lands on zero, you leave with nothing and the barquillero gets to keep the money. With a cruel final click – and the near-audible sound of my spectators craning their necks in unison – the ticker slowed to a stop over a canary-yellow number three. My toes buried in the sand and the smell of saltwater and vanilla filling the air, I took a bite of my winnings, sending a splodge of gooey honey running down my chin. That day, chance – or was it destiny? – had granted me not one, but three of Spain’s last traditional wafer biscuits."

            "name": "The single best food in Japan?",
            "content": "In one of the country’s least-visited prefectures, chefs dramatically sear bonito over towering flames. On the south side of the island of Shikoku, framed by two enormous peninsulas, Kochi is one of Japan’s least-visited prefectures – at least by foreigners. It’s a popular destination for Japanese Shingon Buddhists looking to worship at the auspicious 88 Temples of Shikoku, the country’s most famous pilgrimage trail. But it’s also popular with pilgrims of another kind. Kochi is one of Japan’s least-visited prefectures – at least by foreigners Inside the Hirome Market in Kochi City on a humid August evening, diners were packed shoulder-to-shoulder on communal tables, surrounded by shops and stalls. The hungry chatter grew and the tables quickly filled inside the sprawling, single-storey structure as dinner time approached. Hirome is as busy as this throughout the year, and no matter the season, the most sought-after dish in town is katsuo-no-tataki (seared bonito). Often called “skipjack tuna”, these smaller cousins of tuna are normally found deep at sea, but they swim unusually close to shore just off the Kochi coastline, following large schools of sardines carried by the Kuroshio current. This close proximity allows Kochi residents to eat the fish at its freshest, and over the years, local chefs here have developed a dramatic cooking technique to maximise the bonito’s flavour. The tataki cooking technique is now used around the world, but it originated here in Kochi. Literally meaning “to hit”, it’s a brief searing method lasting around 90 seconds, in which fish or meat is cooked over towering straw-fuelled flames. The flames partly cook the outside of the fish, searing its dark flesh black and leaving its exterior with an intense, smoky barbecue flavour while its inside retains a raw and succulent sashimi quality. Chefs roughly cut it with huge knives into thick slices and serve it alongside spring onions, ginger and garlic and seasoned with salt or soy sauce."

            "name": "BT signs 5G deal with Ericsson to help ditch Huawei",
            "content": "BT has signed a deal to use Ericsson's 5G radio antennas, base stations and other equipment to upgrade its EE mobile network. BT said in time it expected 50% of all its 5G traffic to be transmitted via the Swedish company's kit.  The move will let it ditch Huawei without becoming totally dependent on its other radio access network (Ran) equipment provider, Nokia.  It follows a government ban of the Chinese company's products.  Ministers announced in July that all the UK's mobile providers must stop buying new Huawei 5G telecoms infrastructure after 31 December, and must also remove any of its 5G equipment purchased before that date by 2027.  This was a result of sanctions imposed by Washington, which claims Huawei poses a national security threat - something the company denies.  BT is already in the process of using Ericsson products to replace Huawei's equipment in its 'core' - the most sensitive parts of its network that route data and voice calls across computer servers to get them to the right destination.  Huawei released a report earlier on Wednesday, claiming its UK ban could cost thousands of jobs and billions of pounds of lost economic benefits as a result of the 5G rollout taking longer to complete."
